# `document-structure-tree`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Run `yarn start` to run the app in development mode.
<!-- TODO: Or visit the deployed site.-->

## Styling (CSS in JS)
typed camelCase css objects
using JSX-Pragma `/** @jsx jsx */` (and a [`jsx;` statement](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54006540/emotion-js-with-create-react-app-referenceerror-jsx-is-not-defined))

see https://emotion.sh/docs/object-styles

## Project Folder Structure
At the moment:
- generic folders (`components`, `screens`, `services`)
To be replaced with:
- feature folders (`Tree`, `Settings`, ...)
  e.g. (avoided for too much nesting):
