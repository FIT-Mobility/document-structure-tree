# `document-structure-tree`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Run `yarn start` to run the app in development mode.
<!-- TODO: Or visit the deployed site.-->

## Styling (CSS in JS)
see https://emotion.sh/docs/styled

## Project Folder Structure
At the moment:
- generic folders (`components`, `screens`, `services`)
To be replaced with:
- feature folders (`Tree`, `Settings`, ...)
  e.g. (avoided for too much nesting):
